// t-tui-t101-memory-lifecycle.serial.tui.test.ts — drive the per-stage
// memory.md START→APPROVAL lifecycle (v0.5.0 milestone 13) through a REAL claude TUI.
// PATTERN A (land + render, NOT answer-and-advance): jump to approval-handoff,
// prove memory.md is faithfully created at stage start, WAIT for the approval
// gate to PAINT, and assert the landed state + the rendered gate WHILE PAUSED on
// it — never answering (answering would advance the stage and break the
// Current-Stage==approval-handoff assertion; and the memory.md terminator fires
// at 0 answers before the gate paints — see the PATTERN A note at the wait
// below). A faithful rewrite of tests/integration/t101-stage-memory-lifecycle.sh,
// EQUAL-OR-STRONGER on the same on-disk surface, with the --test-run auto-approve
// crutch REMOVED and the rendered-gate value-add ADDED.
//
// WHAT IT PROVES (the memory.md lifecycle the SKILL.md ## Routing block drives):
//   - init-from-template fires at stage START — the orchestrator copies
//     knowledge/aidlc-shared/memory-template.md into the stage's
//     aidlc-docs/ideation/approval-handoff/memory.md (file exists, non-empty).
//   - the created file carries all FOUR canonical `## ` H2 headings
//     (## Interpretations / ## Deviations / ## Tradeoffs / ## Open questions)
//     — the .sh's assertion 2.
//   - the ownership header is the VERBATIM template blockquote — the .sh's
//     assertion 3 (here asserted UNCONDITIONALLY: stronger than the .sh, which
//     skipped when the orchestrator approximated the copy. A malformed/missing
//     header is a real defect, not LLM variance, so we hold the bar).
//   - the jump landed on disk: aidlc-state.md `Current Stage` == approval-handoff.
//   - parseMemoryHeadings(file).total == the visible `- ` entry count on disk —
//     the .sh's assertion 7 (parser ↔ disk agreement), ported by importing the
//     exported helper from the distributable (aidlc-lib.ts:982; import-safe under
//     bun, never loads node-pty).
//   - RENDER (the tui-only value-add the SDK path is blind to): the captured grid
//     showed the AskUserQuestion approval gate at least once during the run — the
//     `❯` caret + an `Enter to select` / `Submit answers` footer. The .sh, running
//     under --test-run, NEVER saw a painted gate; the menu was auto-approved
//     headlessly. This is the journey a real user actually lives.
//
// WHY PATTERN A (land + render, not answer-and-advance): approval-handoff is a
// GATE stage (its stage file: "Approval gate: Approve / Request Changes /
// Reject"). Without --test-run the orchestrator paints a real AskUserQuestion gate
// and WAITS for a human keystroke; nothing advances until it is answered. This
// journey's contract is the memory.md LIFECYCLE observed WHILE PAUSED ON that gate
// — creation at stage start, fidelity, and that the gate RENDERS — plus the jump
// landing ON approval-handoff (Current Stage == approval-handoff, i.e. NOT
// advanced). So we jump to the stage, prove memory.md was faithfully created,
// WAIT for the approval gate to paint, and assert disk + screen while paused —
// we do NOT answer the gate. Mirrors the committed Pattern-A journeys t24/t27.
//
// WHY NOT answer-gate (the verified failure, per the IRON RULE): two ways an
// answer-gate breaks this journey. (1) With `--until-file memory.md`: memory.md is
// created at stage START (SKILL.md ## Routing: "create on stage start if absent"),
// BEFORE the gate paints, so the disk terminator fires after 0 answers within
// seconds — killing the run before the approval gate paints minutes later, so the
// render proof was false (verified live 2026-06-06: terminator met after 0
// answers, sawGate=false). (2) With a post-approval terminator: answering the gate
// ADVANCES the stage, moving Current Stage OFF approval-handoff and breaking
// assertion #5. Both contradict the contract. The fix is to NOT answer: wait for
// the gate to render (the hang-backstop is the waitFor timeout — if it never
// paints, the test reds, a reachability FINDING never softened). We do NOT assert
// terminal workflow completion (racy; the Phase-2 lesson) and we do NOT assert any
// audit event the .sh did not (it asserted none on the audit surface — it read
// memory.md + the runtime graph). The .sh's assertion 8 (runtime-graph memory_path)
// is NOT ported: it requires a STAGE_STARTED row that a `--stage` JUMP may not emit
// (the .sh itself skipped it conditionally), and compiling the runtime graph is a
// post-hoc deterministic read outside this journey's render+disk surface — better
// folded into the Phase-4 deterministic tier than asserted racily here.
//
// COST: spends real Bedrock tokens (minutes-long LLM turns to reach the gate).
// Gated behind AIDLC_TUI_LIVE=1 so a bare `--e2e` on a laptop SKIPs it; tmux/
// claude/distributable absence (and the Windows node + node-pty checks) also SKIP
// with a reason — never a hollow pass.
//
// SPAWN, not import (D-TUI-7): runs under bun, spawns tui-drive.ts as a
// subprocess (node on Windows so node-pty never loads under bun, #748; bun
// elsewhere). The answer-gate loop lives in the driver — one implementation, both
// backends. The `tui-drive.ts` spawn is what DERIVES the `tui` mechanism (Phase 0);
// no filename mechanism segment is needed or added. Platform-invariant plain-text
// grid asserts — the Windows node-pty leg (via SSM) captures the same grid.
