// covers: stage:inception/reverse-engineering
//
// t72-stage-reverse-engineering.test.ts — SDK-harness port of
// tests/integration/t72-stage-reverse-engineering.sh (plan 15). Drives the real
// `/aidlc` from a state fixture already parked on reverse-engineering through
// the Claude Agent SDK and asserts ONLY on deterministic surfaces — the on-disk RE artifact
// scaffold, the state fields the stage wrote, and the SDK's captured gate — NEVER
// on assistantText.
//
// ⛔ NO --test-run (TRAP 2). The .sh drove `--stage reverse-engineering --test-run`
// so the approval gate AUTO-APPROVED and the stage auto-advanced — that auto-advance
// is also why the .sh's "current stage advanced past RE" assertion was racy (a known
// LLM-tier flake). This port drives the REAL stage and STOPS when its approval gate
// RENDERS (stopAfterAskUserQuestion), the moment the deterministic artifacts + state
// have landed (RE stage steps 3-4 write the 9 artifacts + update state BEFORE step 5
// presents the gate, reverse-engineering.md:78-101). We assert that LANDED surface —
// the §5-A1 land pattern applied to sdk — never the post-approval advance (a moving
// LLM-paced target, the t26/t101 lesson). Known LLM-tier flake (memory) — re-run alone.
//
// THE JOURNEY (verified against the SHIPPED stage). Seed state-brownfield-init-done
// (Lifecycle Phase=INCEPTION, Current Stage=reverse-engineering [-] in-progress,
// Scope=bugfix, Completed=3) + the brownfield-todo stub (a React/Vite/TypeScript Todo
// app). Plain `/aidlc` resumes that current stage directly; jump routing for
// `--stage` is covered by t25/t26. The RE stage: step 2 delegates a developer
// code scan, step 3 the architect synthesises 9 artifacts into
// aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/ (reverse-engineering.md:36,78-89), step 4
// updates state, step 5 renders the AskUserQuestion approval gate. We stop at step 5.
//
// ASSERTION MAP (.sh test -> deterministic SDK surface, equal-or-stronger):
//   1 RE directory created
//       -> existsSync(aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering) on disk.
//   2 RE dir has >= 4 .md artifacts
//       -> readdirSync(reDir).filter(.md).length > 3 (the .sh's assert_gt 3).
//   6 at least one RE artifact > 200 bytes
//       -> statSync(...).size > 200 for >= 1 artifact (the .sh's find -size +200c).
//   7 RE artifacts have markdown headings
//       -> >= 1 artifact matches /^#/m (the .sh's grep -l "^#").
//   8/9/13 RE completion + advance + completed count
//       -> NOT asserted post-approval (those depend on the auto-advance --test-run
//          forced — the racy surface). Instead we assert the DETERMINISTIC landed
//          state at the gate: Current Stage === reverse-engineering (the stage is
//          active, jump/stage set it) — the stable pre-approval truth.
//   10 RE mentions component/module structure (3, 4, 5, 11 domain-word probes)
//       -> NOT a hard word grep (LLM-authored RE output varies; the .sh tied these
//          to the todo stub with assert_gt 0 / skip-on-miss). The faithful
//          equal-or-stronger assertion is on STRUCTURE (>= 4 artifacts, headings,
//          size) — the t50/t-tui-t50 reasoning: hard-asserting a domain word would
//          be brittle, not stronger. The stub IS a React/Vite Todo app, so the
//          domain is present in the scanned source; we assert the framework-
//          guaranteed artifact SCAFFOLD.
//   15 lifecycle phase is INCEPTION
//       -> readStateField(state,"Lifecycle Phase") === "INCEPTION" (RE is inception).
//   + the approval gate RENDERED (the stage reached its gate, no vacuous pass):
//       -> r.askedQuestions.length > 0 (stopAfterAskUserQuestion fired).
//
// Known-answer literals (read from the SHIPPED stage, not guessed):
//   - RE outputs (9 artifacts):   reverse-engineering.md:36, written :78-89
//   - approval gate (step 5):     reverse-engineering.md:97-103 (AskUserQuestion)
//   - fixture init-done state:     state-brownfield-init-done.md (Phase=INCEPTION,
//                                  Current Stage=reverse-engineering, Scope=bugfix)
//   - brownfield-todo stub:        tests/fixtures/brownfield-todo (React/Vite/TS Todo)
