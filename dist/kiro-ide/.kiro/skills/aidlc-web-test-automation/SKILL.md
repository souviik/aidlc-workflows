# Web Test Automation

Best-practice guidance for building durable, low-flakiness automated tests for web applications. **Playwright (TypeScript) is the default stack**; Cypress and Selenium are covered for existing investments and migration.

This skill teaches an agent *how to do web test automation well* — it does not replace the official docs. When writing real test code, also consult the current Playwright / Cypress docs for exact API shapes, since these tools move fast.

## When to Load Reference Files

Load only the reference files relevant to the current task:

| If the task involves… | Load |
|---|---|
| Designing the test approach — deciding what to test, scope, data, flakiness policy, CI/reporting (a starting set you expand per project) | `references/qa-design-decisions.md` |
| Choosing a framework (Playwright vs Cypress vs Selenium) | `references/tool-selection.md` |
| Writing selectors / fixing brittle selectors | `references/locators-and-selectors.md` |
| Assertions, waiting, eliminating flakiness, trace debugging | `references/assertions-waiting-and-flakiness.md` |
| Structuring the suite (page objects, fixtures, test data) | `references/architecture-pom-fixtures.md` |
| Test isolation, programmatic login, reusing auth state | `references/test-isolation-and-auth.md` |
| API testing and network mocking inside web flows | `references/api-testing-and-network-mocking.md` |
| Accessibility (axe-core) and visual regression | `references/accessibility-and-visual-regression.md` |
| CI, parallelization, sharding, artifacts | `references/ci-and-parallelization.md` |
| Migrating from Cypress or Selenium to Playwright | `references/migration-to-playwright.md` |

## Core Principles (the substance)

These are the highest-value rules. Encode them into every suite you design.

### 1. Locators: user-facing first
- Prefer role/label/text locators (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`); fall back to test IDs (`getByTestId` → `data-testid` / `data-cy`).
- Avoid CSS/XPath tied to DOM structure or styling — they break on every refactor.
- Centralize selectors in one place (a page object) so a UI change is a one-line fix.

### 2. Waiting & flakiness (the #1 source of pain)
- Use **web-first, auto-retrying assertions**: `await expect(locator).toBeVisible()` — **never** `expect(await locator.isVisible()).toBe(true)`.
- **Never use fixed sleeps** (`page.waitForTimeout`, `cy.wait(<number>)`). Wait on conditions, events, or network responses instead.
- Lint for missing awaits (`@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`) and run `tsc --noEmit` in CI.
- Diagnose flakiness with the **trace viewer**; harden critical tests with `--repeat-each=N`.

### 3. Test isolation & data
- Every test runs independently with its own state. Verify by running a test alone.
- Set up / reset state in `beforeEach`, **not** `after*` (cleanup may not run on failure).
- Control state programmatically — seed via **API or DB**, not UI clicks.
- Log in once via API / `storageState` (Playwright setup project; Cypress `cy.session()`) and reuse the signed-in state.

### 4. Scope discipline
- Only test what you control. **Mock third-party/external services** via network interception (`page.route`, `cy.intercept`). Don't hit real external servers.

### 5. Architecture
- Page Object Model centralizes selectors + exposes domain-level methods.
- In Playwright, prefer **fixtures** for setup/teardown and **POM** for UI abstraction — know when to use which.
- Keep the test body thin; push reuse into fixtures/factories.

### 6. Cross-cutting test types inside web E2E
- **API testing:** validate endpoints and use the API to set up preconditions / assert postconditions.
- **Accessibility:** integrate `@axe-core/playwright`; scope scans; gate on WCAG tags.
- **Visual regression:** `toHaveScreenshot` with platform-suffixed baselines; mask dynamic content; tune `maxDiffPixels`; generate baselines in a consistent (ideally Dockerized) env.

### 7. CI integration
- Run on every PR/commit; use Linux runners; install only needed browsers (`--with-deps`).
- Shard across machines for speed; use **trace-on-first-retry** (not always-on); publish the HTML report + trace artifacts.

## Tool Selection Quick Reference

| Tool | Default for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Playwright (TS)** | **Everything new** | Auto-waiting, cross-browser (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit), built-in API + a11y + visual + component testing, codegen, trace viewer, native sharding. **Recommend this in decision files.** |
| **Cypress** | Teams with deep Cypress investment | Great time-travel runner & component DX; weaker true cross-browser/WebKit, single-tab, harder multi-origin. |
| **Selenium / WebDriver** | Legacy grids, languages/browsers Playwright can't target | Otherwise migrate (`references/migration-to-playwright.md`). |

See `references/tool-selection.md` for the full decision tree.

## Configuration

- **Default project layout:** `tests/` for specs, `tests/pages/` for page objects, `tests/fixtures/` for fixtures, `playwright.config.ts` at root.
- **Recommended Playwright config:** `trace: 'on-first-retry'`, `retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0`, `fullyParallel: true`, projects per browser, a `setup` project for auth.
- **Install:** `npm init playwright@latest` (adds config, GitHub Actions workflow, example tests).
- **Lint gate:** enable `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`; run `tsc --noEmit` in CI to catch missing awaits.

## Language / Framework Selection

- **Default:** Playwright + TypeScript.
- **Override only when the user explicitly asks** for Cypress, Selenium, or another language binding, or when an existing suite dictates it. Surface the tradeoff in the decision file before overriding.
