# Mobile Test Automation

Best-practice guidance for building durable, low-flakiness automated tests for mobile applications across **iOS, Android, React Native, and Flutter**. The right tool depends on the app — this skill leads with a decision tree, then encodes the cross-cutting principles that make mobile suites reliable.

This skill teaches an agent *how to do mobile test automation well* — it does not replace the official docs. When writing real test code, also consult the current Appium / Maestro / Detox / Espresso / XCUITest docs, and verify **AWS Device Farm** capabilities via the AWS Knowledge MCP, since support matrices and pricing change.

## When to Load Reference Files

Load only the reference files relevant to the current task:

| If the task involves… | Load |
|---|---|
| Designing the test approach — deciding what to test, scope, data, device strategy, flakiness policy, device-cloud/CI (a starting set you expand per project) | `references/qa-design-decisions.md` |
| Choosing a framework (Appium / Maestro / Detox / Espresso / XCUITest) | `references/tool-selection.md` |
| Appium setup, capabilities, parallel session isolation | `references/appium-setup.md` |
| Maestro YAML flows, selectors, subflows, Studio/Cloud | `references/maestro-flows.md` |
| React Native (Detox gray-box sync) or Flutter testing | `references/detox-and-flutter.md` |
| Native Android (Espresso) or native iOS (XCUITest) | `references/espresso-and-xcuitest.md` |
| Eliminating mobile flakiness (waits, animations, network, permissions, isolation) | `references/flakiness-mobile.md` |
| Gestures, deep links, network conditions, app lifecycle | `references/gestures-lifecycle-and-deeplinks.md` |
| Emulator/simulator vs real device, building the device matrix | `references/device-strategy.md` |
| Device farms + CI (AWS Device Farm, BrowserStack, Sauce, GitHub Actions) | `references/device-farm-and-ci.md` |

## Tool Selection Quick Reference

| Tool | Use when | Avoid when |
|---|---|---|
| **Appium** | One API across iOS + Android (+ web), language flexibility, no vendor lock-in, unmodified production apps | RN-only determinism needs, or zero-maintenance goal — it's black-box, so you manage waits + a layered iOS stack |
| **Maestro** | Simple, fast, low-maintenance E2E with built-in flakiness tolerance; broad coverage (Native, Compose, SwiftUI, RN, Flutter, Web); great PR smoke gate | You need white-box in-process access to app state |
| **Detox** | React Native apps wanting gray-box, zero-flakiness determinism | Non-RN apps; broad cross-stack coverage |
| **Espresso** | Native Android, tight UI-thread sync, fast dev/CI feedback | Cross-platform; iOS |
| **XCUITest** | Native iOS, first-party Xcode integration | Cross-platform; Android |

**Decision shortcuts:** RN → Detox or Maestro · Flutter → Maestro or `integration_test` (Detox doesn't cover Flutter) · Native iOS → XCUITest · Native Android → Espresso · One shared cross-platform suite → Appium (more upkeep) or Maestro (simpler) · PR smoke gate → Maestro. **Maestro is the rising modern default for E2E** — foreground it when the user has no existing investment.

See `references/tool-selection.md` for the full tree.

## Core Principles (the substance)

### 1. Locators: stable machine-facing IDs
- Prefer stable IDs over visible text/position. iOS: `accessibilityIdentifier`; Android: `resource-id` / content-description; React Native: `testID` → Detox `by.id`.
- **Avoid XPath** — ~10× slower, brittle; on iOS it forces a full page-source snapshot. Last resort only.
- Espresso: use the least-specific matcher that uniquely identifies one view; assert in `.check()`, never inside `onView()`.
- Maestro: prefer visible `text` for readability, switch to `id` for icons/localized apps; anchor with relational selectors, not indices.
- Use inspectors (Appium Inspector, Maestro Studio) to discover locators.

### 2. Synchronization & flakiness (the #1 source of pain)
- **Never use hard sleeps** — the top flakiness anti-pattern.
- Prefer explicit/conditional (poll-until) waits over implicit; never mix the two.
- Lean on auto-synchronizing frameworks: Espresso (idle queue + IdlingResource), Detox (gray-box auto-wait on RN bridge/timers/animations), Maestro (auto-waits for network + animations). iOS XCUITest: `waitForExistence(timeout:)` / `XCTWaiter`, not sleeps.
- **Disable system animations** on test devices (Android: set 3 animation scales to 0 via adb; Appium `disableWindowAnimation`).
- **Stub the network**; don't hit real backends (MockWebServer/WireMock on Android; OHHTTPStubs on iOS). Deliberately exercise slow/faulty paths.
- **Pre-grant permissions**; never tap OS dialogs (Appium `autoGrantPermissions`/`autoAcceptAlerts`; Espresso `GrantPermissionRule`; XCUITest `addUIInterruptionMonitor`; Detox `launchApp({permissions})`).
- Enforce **test isolation** with a known-clean start (prefer build-up at start over teardown). Reset ladders: Appium `noReset`→fast→`fullReset`; Detox `newInstance`→`resetAppState`→`delete`.

### 3. Device strategy
- Emulators/simulators for the fast dev loop and primary CI coverage; the iOS Simulator is **not** accurate for performance/memory/network.
- Always validate hardware-dependent paths on **real devices**: sensors, camera/mic, biometrics, GPS, GPU, carrier network, payments, store install flows.
- Build the real-device matrix from **your own user analytics**, not a generic list.

### 4. Mobile-specific concerns
- **Gestures:** use parameterized gesture APIs, not raw coordinates (Appium `mobile: swipeGesture`; Espresso `scrollTo()`/`RecyclerViewActions`; XCUITest `swipeUp()`/`pinch`).
- **Deep links** to jump straight to a screen instead of multi-step navigation (faster, less flaky): adb `am start`, Appium `mobile: deepLink`, Detox `launchApp({url})`, XCUITest `app.open(URL)`.
- **Network conditions:** simulate offline/3G/latency to catch reconnection bugs.
- **App lifecycle:** test background/foreground, process-death recovery, launch-from-notification, and app/DB upgrades.

### 5. CI & the test pyramid
- Run on every push/PR with animations off and devices reset clean; parallelize across devices/sessions (Appium: isolate each session with unique `udid`/`wdaLocalPort`/`derivedDataPath`).
- Use a managed device cloud for parallel scale and automatic teardown.
- Many small/fast tests at the base, few E2E at the tip. Push each check to the lowest layer that gives the right feedback.

## AWS Device Farm — read before recommending it

⚠️ **Critical caveat:** AWS Device Farm's managed test runner does **not** support every mobile framework — frameworks like Detox, Flutter, and Maestro are not first-class, and Espresso typically runs only when packaged as an Android Instrumentation test. If the team has committed to one of those, Device Farm may be a poor fit; BrowserStack or Sauce Labs are usually safer for the broadest framework + device coverage. **Do not quote the support matrix or pricing from memory — both change. Always verify current capabilities and cost via the AWS Knowledge MCP before putting them in a decision file.** Default to AWS Device Farm when the workload already lives in AWS (native CodePipeline test action, VPC-private test backends) and the framework is Appium/XCUITest. See `references/device-farm-and-ci.md`.

## Configuration

- **Maestro:** install via `curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash`; flows are YAML in `.maestro/`; `maestro test flow.yaml`; `maestro studio` to author selectors.
- **Appium:** `npm i -g appium`; install drivers (`appium driver install xcuitest`, `appium driver install uiautomator2`); use Appium Inspector for locators.
- **Detox:** `npm i -D detox`; configure `.detoxrc.js`; `detox build` then `detox test`.
- **CI runners:** Android emulators on larger Linux runners with KVM (`reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner`) — 2–3× faster and cheaper than macOS; reserve macOS runners for iOS build/sign/test.

## Platform / Framework Selection

- **Default for new cross-platform E2E:** Maestro (simplicity + flakiness tolerance), or Appium when broad language/platform reach and device-cloud parity are required.
- **React Native:** Detox (determinism) or Maestro.
- **Native Android / iOS:** Espresso / XCUITest respectively.
- **Override only when the user explicitly asks** or an existing suite dictates it. Surface the tradeoff in the decision file before overriding.
